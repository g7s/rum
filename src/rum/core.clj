                - `reset!` result of `f` to the sink atom.
             - Return sink atom.

             Example:

             ```
             (def *a (atom 0))
             (def *b (atom 1))

             Arguments:

             - `refs` - sequence of source refs,
             - `key`  - unique key to register watcher, same as in `clojure.core/add-watch`,
             - `f`    - function that must accept N arguments (same as number of source refs) and return a value to be written to the sink ref. Note: `f` will be called with already dereferenced values,
             - `opts` - optional. Map of:
               - `:ref` - use this as sink ref. By default creates new atom,
               - `:eq-fn` - Defaults to `=`. An equality check function.  With the default when the result of recalculating `f` equals to the old value, `reset!` won’t be called. Set to `(constantly false)` if checking for equality can be expensive."}
